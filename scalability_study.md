Scalability Study: Quantum-Enhanced PDE Solver for 1D Burgers' Equation via HSE
This section analyzes how the quantum resources required for our Hydrodynamic Schrödinger Equation (HSE) based solver scale with increasing grid resolution. Understanding these scaling trends is crucial for assessing the long-term potential of quantum algorithms for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems.

Resource Scaling with Grid Size (N 
x
​
 )
The primary advantage of quantum algorithms for PDE solving, particularly with amplitude encoding, lies in how quantum resources scale compared to classical methods.

Qubit Footprint
For amplitude encoding, where the discretized values of ϕ(x,t) are stored in the amplitudes of a quantum state, the number of qubits required scales logarithmically with the number of spatial grid points (N 
x
​
 ).

Scaling: O(log 
2
​
 N 
x
​
 )

Implication: This is an exponential compression of the state space compared to classical methods, which require O(N 
x
​
 ) memory. For instance, moving from a 16-point grid (4 qubits) to a 256-point grid (8 qubits) only requires doubling the number of qubits, whereas classical memory would increase by a factor of 16. This is a significant advantage for tackling problems with very high resolution.

Two-Qubit Gate Depth
The circuit depth, particularly the two-qubit gate depth, is a critical metric for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices, as deeper circuits are more susceptible to noise. The depth of our HSE solver's time evolution circuit depends on two main factors:

Number of Trotter Steps (N 
steps
​
 ): The total simulation time is divided into N 
steps
​
  (or num_trotter_steps_per_quantum_step for each quantum step). The circuit depth scales linearly with N 
steps
​
 . A higher N 
steps
​
  generally leads to better accuracy but deeper circuits.

Complexity of Hamiltonian Decomposition: The discretized Laplacian operator (our effective Hamiltonian) is decomposed into a sum of Pauli terms. For a 1D grid with nearest-neighbor interactions (as typically arises from central difference approximations), the number of such Pauli terms scales linearly with the number of grid points, O(N 
x
​
 ). Each Pauli term's exponential (e.g., e 
−iθP
 ) is implemented using a sequence of single-qubit rotations and CNOT gates. For 1D interactions, the number of CNOTs per Trotter step scales linearly with the number of qubits, O(logN 
x
​
 ).

Overall Scaling: The two-qubit gate depth for the time evolution part scales as O(N 
steps
​
 ⋅logN 
x
​
 ).

Implication: While the qubit count scales logarithmically, the depth still scales with logN 
x
​
 . This means that achieving very high resolutions (N 
x
​
 ) will still lead to deeper circuits, posing a challenge for current noisy hardware. However, this is generally more favorable than classical methods where computational time often scales polynomially with N 
x
​
 .

T-count
The T-count refers to the number of T-gates (and their adjoints, T 
†
 ) in a quantum circuit. T-gates are crucial for universal quantum computation but are generally expensive to implement fault-tolerantly and contribute significantly to circuit depth and error propagation.

Scaling: The T-count primarily arises from implementing arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates (e.g., Rz, Rx, Ry, Rzz) that appear in the Trotterized time evolution. Each arbitrary rotation typically requires a constant number of T-gates for a given precision (e.g., using Solovay-Kitaev theorem). Since the number of rotation gates in the Trotterized evolution scales with the number of Pauli terms and Trotter steps, the T-count will scale similarly to the two-qubit gate depth: O(N 
steps
​
 ⋅logN 
x
​
 ).

Implication: Minimizing T-count is essential for future fault-tolerant quantum computers. Efficient gate synthesis and optimized Hamiltonian decompositions are critical to keep this resource low.

Implications for Finer Grids and Higher Dimensions
Finer Grids (Increased N 
x
​
 )
1D: As discussed, qubits scale logarithmically, while depth and T-count scale linearly with logN 
x
​
 . This makes finer 1D grids more accessible than higher dimensions.

Impact: For NISQ devices, the depth scaling is the primary bottleneck. Achieving very high resolution in 1D might still require more coherent qubits or advanced error mitigation than currently available.

Higher Dimensions (e.g., 2D or 3D flows)
Extending this HSE approach to higher dimensions would significantly impact resource scaling:

Qubits: For a D-dimensional problem with N 
x
​
  points along each dimension, the total number of grid points would be N 
x
D
​
 . The number of qubits would scale as O(DlogN 
x
​
 ). This remains a logarithmic advantage.

Gate Depth & T-count: The complexity of the Laplacian operator in higher dimensions increases. The number of Pauli terms in the Hamiltonian decomposition would scale as O(D⋅N 
x
D−1
​
 ) (or O(D⋅N 
x
​
 ) if mapped to a chain-like structure, but with more complex local interactions). This would lead to a significantly higher circuit depth and T-count, scaling at least polynomially with N 
x
​
  or even exponentially with the number of qubits for dense interactions.

Impact: Solving 2D or 3D Burgers' or Navier-Stokes equations on quantum computers is a much harder problem due to the increased connectivity and complexity of the Hamiltonian terms, leading to much deeper circuits. This is where the "minimal classical pre/post-processing overhead" and "low circuit depth" goals become extremely challenging.

Conclusion
The HSE framework offers a compelling exponential advantage in qubit count (O(logN 
x
​
 )) for solving the 1D Burgers' equation. However, the circuit depth and T-count scale polynomially with logN 
x
​
  (for 1D), which remains a critical challenge for noisy near-term quantum hardware. For higher-dimensional problems, the scaling of depth and T-count becomes even more demanding. Future advancements in fault-tolerant quantum computing, more efficient Hamiltonian simulation algorithms, and improved error mitigation techniques will be necessary to fully realize the potential of quantum-enhanced PDE solvers for complex CFD applications.
